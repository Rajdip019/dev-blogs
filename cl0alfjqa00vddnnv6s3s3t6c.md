## How to contribute in GSSoC and get the most out of it?üöÄ

# The Story

Recently, I have been selected as a GSSoC Contributor '22 and posted that in LinkedIn. And I am shocked to see that the amount of people don't know what to do and where to start. And also saw a lots of them who know the initial steps to contribute and doing it in the worst way possible.üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So, in this blog I will try explain what to do and how to do and how you can make the most of it in terms of learning and making connections. And read till the end to get the bonus point, yes the most important point of this blog.‚≠ê

## What is your goals in this programme?üöÄ

If getting a certificate, swags or the cash prize is your main goal then I would say that readjust your goals and focus more on learning and making connections because in long term the connections you make and what you learn will stay with you not the certificate or the swag.


# Let's with how to get Started with contribution?

 ## Find your Project

Go to GSSoC official page and move tom projects tab. Here is a link to that. 
[Link‚û°Ô∏è](https://gssoc.girlscript.tech/project)

Select your stack, like : JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Search through the 100 projects listed 
there open the GitHub repository and see their code once, don't just to the issue tab directly.üëá

Take your time and pick 2-3 repository where you know the tech-stack and can contribute. Don't just go and spam in every issue of every repository , like: **"Can I work on this issue?".** I see a lot of people doing that, please don't do that.

 ## Finding the first Issue.   üöÄ

After you select your repository go and find easy **level-1 ** or **good first issue** which you think you can solve. Like this one.üëá

Comment there that you would like to work on that issue and explain a bit how you will solve the problem or implement the new feature. It will help the project admin and the mentor to feel confident that you can solve the issue and also you will be able to stand out of the crowd.üòú

  ### What if all the issues you can do are assigned?

  In that case you can ask the mentor or the project admin to allow you to collaborate with the person already assigned. If he/she agrees just collaborate together. collaborating with a unknown person will boost your learnings in many way.

Or you can simply use their app and find genuine bugs in that. If you find one then raise a issue by your self clicking the  ` New issue ` button.üëá

And tell the project admin and mentor that you will love to work on that issue.

And yeah you got your first issue to work on!


 ## Setting up the system in your local system.

I am not going to guide you through how you can clone and run a programme in your local system, there is a lot of tutorial on that already.

 ### But what happens if you face a error while setting up the project in your local system?

You can just take the screenshot of the error and share them in the specific discord channel of the project and tag project admin or Mentor.

 #### How to identify mentor and project admin in discord?
Mentors have a ` | M | <Project Name> ` after their name and Admin have ` | PA | <Project Name> ` after their name.

They will solve the issue by chat or using the voice channel of the specific project.

And after you all setup go and do your job and make a PR. And **YAY** you have done your first contribution in GSSoC.


# Bonus/Important Points.

Don't spam in every issue of every project. Take a project and contribute in that project for long term.

 #### How it's gonna help?  üëá‚≠ê
 - You will be a proper part of building something.
 - You will have a good connection with the project mentor and admin. And you will be easily assigned in issues.
 - By working with a codebase for a good amount of time you will find much more issue in the code that no one other will find out and you can raise the issues and work on them.
 - Eventually you will learn a lot of more by not hoping around from project to project.
 - You will learn to work in a team.


So, this is the end. Please share this as much as possible and help each other.
