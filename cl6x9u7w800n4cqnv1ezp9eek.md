## HTML, CSS, Javascript won't give you a job! 😫

Yes, this is true.✅

I have seen many beginners are sold false dreams that they will get a job/internship after learning HTML, CSS and JS.❌

### What actually do you need to have to get an good internship or a job as a front-end developer❓

1. Basics - HTML, CSS, JS 👁️

2. CSS Frameworks - Bootstrap , Tailwind ( but good core vanilla CSS knowledge is also enough ) ⚡

3. React ✨

4. Have experience of working with APIs. 💥

Now the question comes where to learn them? 

- You can learn them from YouTube for free, there are channels like -> Hitesh Chowdhury, Thapa Technical, Traversy Media, Clever Programmer and more.

These are bare minimum skills you need to know before you apply for a front-end role as an intern.✅

Now having a good skill set is also not enough.❌


### What you want more⁉️

1. A good project that shows your skill level.🔰

2. Good speaking and communication skills.📢

3. A good resume.📄

4. Good english writing skills.🔍


If you have all of these skills then go ahead and start applying.🚀

Or start working on building these skills.🙌
